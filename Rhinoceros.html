<p>Rhinos once roamed many places throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa and were known to early Europeans who depicted 
them in cave paintings. At the beginning of the 20th century, 500,000 rhinos roamed Africa and Asia. By 1970, rhino 
numbers dropped to 70,000, and today, as few as 29,000 rhinos remain in the wild. Very few rhinos survive outside 
national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades. Three species of rhino—black, 
Javan, and Sumatran—are critically endangered. Today, a small population of Javan rhinos is found in only one national 
park on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Java. A mainland subspecies of the Javan rhino was declared extinct 
in Vietnam in 2011. Successful conservation efforts have led to an increase in the number of greater one-horned (or Indian) 
rhinos, from around 200 at the turn of the 20th century to more than 3,700 today. The greater one-horned rhino is one of Asia’s 
biggest success stories, with their status improving from endangered to vulnerable following significant population increases. 
However, the species still remains under threat from poaching for its horn and from habitat loss and degradation.
In Africa, southern white rhinos, once thought to be extinct, now thrive in protected sanctuaries and are classified as 
near threatened. But the western black rhino and northern white rhinos have recently become extinct in the wild. 
The only two remaining northern white rhino are kept under 24-hour guard in Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Black rhinos have 
doubled in number over the past two decades from their low point of fewer than 2,500 individuals, but total numbers are still 
a fraction of the estimated 100,000 that existed in the early part of the 20th century.</p>
<h2>Black rhino</h2>
<p>To protect black rhinos from poaching and habitat loss, WWF is taking action in three key African rhino range countries: 
Namibia, South Africa, and Kenya. Together, these nations hold about 87% of the total black rhino population.WWF is working 
with government agencies and partners in these countries to support law enforcement agencies, build support for rhinos in 
surrounding communities, develop and build on innovative tech solutions, and equip and train rangers to stop poachers. 
We also support translocation efforts to establish new black rhino populations in these countries to ensure the species is 
healthy and growing.</p>

<h2>rhino</h2>
<p>Only 67 Javan rhinos are currently estimated to remain in the world, making this critically endangered rhino species one 
of the most threatened large mammal species on Earth. They’re confined to one park on the extreme southwestern tip of the 
Indonesian island of Java—Ujung Kulon National Park. WWF is supporting Rhino Protection Units in Ujung Kulon National Park, 
Java, to safeguard the last remaining population of Javan rhinos from poaching and habitat loss. WWF is working to remove the 
invasive arenga palm tree, which has squeezed out the rhino’s native food plants in 6,178 acres of former habitat within the park. 
Extraction of the palm within the park will be followed by active restoration of natural vegetation and food plants for rhinos. 
WWF also conducts research, including camera trap monitoring, which continues to reveal critical information about behavioral patterns, 
distribution, movement, population size, sex ratio, and genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Sumatran rhino</h2>
<p>The Sumatran rhino is the most threatened of all rhino species, with fewer than 80 surviving in fragmented sub-populations across 
Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. While there are fewer Javan rhino individuals, the remaining Javan rhino all live 
in one site and are a healthy breeding population. The Sumatran rhino, on the other hand, all live in very small and highly fragmented 
populations on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia. These remaining animals are isolated in fragmented pockets of forests 
that prevent them breeding. The smallest rhinos on Earth, Sumatran rhinos remain in small and isolated areas, limiting reproduction in the 
wild. As a result, these populations have been on the decline.In support of the government of Indonesia’s efforts, WWF, Global Wildlife 
Conservation, International Rhino Foundation, International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the National Geographic Society have joined 
together with Indonesian partners on-the-ground to launch a Sumatran Rhino Rescue effort. Beginning in 2018, this alliance of organizations 
aims to relocate the widely dispersed rhino populations from the wild to managed breeding facilities designed specifically for their care. 
In addition to securing the remaining rhino population, the effort will develop the infrastructure to care for the rhinos and grow their 
numbers with the long-term objective of releasing these animals back into the wild.</p>

<h2>Greater one-horned rhino</h2>
<p>The recovery of the greater one-horned rhino is among the greatest conservation success stories in Asia. Today, this rhino population 
stands at more than 3,700 individuals, a significant increase from around 200 remaining at the turn of the 20th century. Strict protection 
and management action from Indian and Nepalese authorities and their partners are responsible for bringing the species back from the brink.
However, the species’ remarkable recovery is constrained by a lack of adequate habitat and the ongoing threat of poaching for their horns. 
Currently, 85% of all greater one-horned rhinos are concentrated in just two locations in India and Nepal.To ensure continued recovery of 
the greater one-horned rhino, WWF is supporting the establishment of new populations by translocating rhinos to protected areas with suitable
habitat within the species’ historic range. Translocating rhinos from the two main populations will allow both groups to expand into new 
territories and will also decrease densities in crowded parks, leading to increased breeding rates. We are setting up systematic monitoring 
programs to measure the health and status of resident and newly translocated rhinos, as well as supporting effective protection measures.
